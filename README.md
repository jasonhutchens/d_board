d-board
=======

RocketHands is a fledgling indie game studio, formed around the concept of
jamming to prove gameplay ideas, and building upon the fruits of this labour to
develop commercial-quality titles.

The d-board is a RocketHands Labs Project. It is a proof-of-concept of a new
metaphor for text input that is optimised for game controllers, providing a good
alternative for the traditional on-screen keyboard interface.

It uses a predictive language model to guess which characters the user is likely
to enter next, in much the same way that some text compression algorithms work,
but with the aim of minimising user effort (rather than minimising bits).
